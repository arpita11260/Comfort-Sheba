          <!-- <span>1st Jan 2021</span> -->
        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>According to the American Heart Association and American Red Cross 2019 guidelines, the steps to take when a cardiac arrest is suspected are: </strong> <br><br>
          <b>1.</b> Command someone to call 911 or the medical alert system for the locale. <br>
          <b>2.</b> Immediately start chest compressions regardless of your training. Compress hard and fast in the center of the chest, allowing recoil between compressions. Hand this task over to those who are trained if and when they arrive. <br>
          <b>3.</b> If you are trained, use chest compressions and rescue breathing. <br>
          <b>4.</b> An AED should be applied and used. But it is essential not to delay chest compressions, so finding one should be commanded to someone else while you are doing chest compressions.

          <b>1.</b> Cover the wound with a gauze or a cloth. <br>
          <b>2.</b> Apply direct pressure to stop the blood flow. <br>

          <span class="title">Frostbite</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          Frostbite occurs when the body's tissues freeze deeply in the cold. Ice crystals that form in the tissues cause damage to the cells. This is the opposite of a burn, but it does almost identical damage to the skin. <br>

          Treating frostbite is a delicate procedure of gradual warming. If at all possible, this should be done by professionals at a medical facility. First, get out of the cold. Small areas of minor frostbite may be rewarmed by skin-to-skin contact, but avoid using any heat sources or hot packs. <br>

          <strong>If you can't make it to a medical facility, use immersion of the affected area in warm water (98 to 105 F) for 20 to 30 minutes to rewarm it. Do not rub the affected area or use heat sources. </strong><br>

          <strong>Bee stings are either annoyingly painful or deadly, depending on if the victim is allergic to the venom. Use these bee sting first aid tips: </strong> <br><br>
          <b>1.</b> Get the stinger out any way you can to prevent more venom being delivered. It's a myth that any particular way is better or worse. <br>
          <b>2.</b> If the person is known to be allergic to bee stings, use an EpiPen to prevent anaphylaxis or call 911 if none is available. <br>
          <b>3.</b> Use a cold pack to reduce swelling at the site, but take care not to cause frostbite. <br>
          <b>4.</b> Use an antihistamine like Benadryl (diphenhydramine) to reduce swelling and itching. <br>
          <b>5.</b> Try ibuprofen or Tylenol (acetaminophen) for pain. <br>
          <b>6.</b> Monitor the person who was stung by signs of anaphylaxis, including hives, redness or itching in other areas of the body, and shortness of breath.

          <b>1.</b> Rinse the area of the sting generously with vinegar for at least 30 seconds. If you don't have vinegar available, use a baking soda slurry instead. <br>
          <b>2.</b> Immerse the affected area in hot water, as hot as the person can tolerate, for at least 20 minutes or until the pain goes away. If hot water isn't available, use dry hot packs. If those aren't available, use dry cold packs. Other methods to relieve pain are less effective (such as urine, fresh water wash, papain or meat tenderizer). <br>
          <b>3.</b> Do not use a pressure bandage.

        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>We all are facing alergy problems.Its reactions occur when your body is hypersensitive to a foreign substance. Bee stings, certain foods, or drug ingredients can cause allergic reactions. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that can be caused by all of those mention allergens. <br>

          The best way to treat an allergic reaction is to use an EpiPen. EpiPen, or “epinephrine autoinjector,” is a small and ergonomic needle that’s used to inject epinephrine (adrenaline) into someone suffering greatly from an allergic reaction. The epinephrine usually subdues the effects of the allergic reaction. <br>
        
          If someone is suffering from an allergic reaction: </strong> <br><br>
          <b>1.</b> Cool, moist skin
          <b>2.</b>Heavy sweating
          <b>3.</b>Dizziness
          <b>4.</b>Weak pulse
          <b>5.</b>Muscle cramps
          <b>6.</b>Headaches <br><br>
          <strong>To treat someone with heat exhaustion: </strong><br><br>

          <b>1.</b> Keep the person calm. Ask if they use an EpiPen and have one with them. <br>
          <b>2.</b> Have the person lie on their back. Keep their feet elevated 12 inches. <br>
          <b>3.</b> Make sure the person’s clothing is loose so they’re able to breathe. <br>
          <b>4.</b> Avoid giving them food, drink, or medicine. <br>
          <b>5.</b> If appropriate, use an EpiPen. Learn how to inject an EpiPen in someone having a reaction. <br>
          <b>6.</b> Wait 5-15 minutes after using an EpiPen. If the allergic reaction isn’t subdued, a second dose may be required.
